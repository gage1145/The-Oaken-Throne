# [[Elias]]' Bender
[[Jem]] and [[Sebael Targus]] are following Elias while he's on his bender of asking to murder kids' bullies. We were also looking for [[Spoon]]. Sebael was a little hesitant that we were looking for a friendly [[Lamia]]. On the way, Elias attempts to pickpocket a rando and takes their necklace. He offers to swipe a necklace for Sebael, but he refuses the kind gesture.

We made it to the medicus where we left Spoon. He said that Spoon left a couple weeks ago. We suspect that he went back to be with that one hoe that he was obsessed with in [[Blackford]]. We decide to return to the inn.
# Back at the Inn
A skinny little twink approaches [[Y-lana]] while she's with Sir Grim and [[Jovis]]. It's [[Sir Pergrim Dentar]]! [[Sir Grim]] tells him to join the group. He asked if they had met with [[Sir Henek Olem]] since he had tried arresting the group the first time. Sir Grim does most of the talking to try and divert his attention. Maybe he's a fucking narc? 

Jovis deduces that this guy does not give a shit about what Sir Grim is saying about [[Lot van Culnar]]. He's obviously just trying to determine if we've had any more interaction with [[The Knight Guard]]. Jovis decides to bore him with a story of woodworking to get him to stop prying.

Elias, Jem, and Sebael made it back to the Inn. Sir Grim informs us that Sir Pergrim visited them while they were gone. 
# Meeting Whitefeather
Sebael has met [[Errog]] who gave the group the invitation to Whitefeather. 

Sebael and Elias sleep on the roof to divine the stars. Elias asks about a symbol etched into his skin. He acquired it when imprisoned in a mine. Sebael said it was familiar, but that he would need to meditate on it. He found out it was a symbol for the god [[Nangifer]], the god of monsters. Ripped his way out of his father and fed on his guts.

Elias looked at the stars and got the feeling that they were not walking into a trap.
