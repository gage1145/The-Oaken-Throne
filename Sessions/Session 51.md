# [[Elias]]' Bender
[[Jem]] and [[Sebael Targus]] are following Elias while he's on his bender of asking to murder kids' bullies. We were also looking for [[Spoon]]. Sebael was a little hesitant that we were looking for a friendly [[Lamia]]. On the way, Elias attempts to pickpocket a rando and takes their necklace. He offers to swipe a necklace for Sebael, but he refuses the kind gesture.

We made it to the medicus where we left Spoon. He said that Spoon left a couple weeks ago. We suspect that he went back to be with that one hoe that he was obsessed with in [[Blackford]]. We decide to return to the inn.
# Back at the Inn
A skinny little twink approaches [[Y-lana]] while she's with Sir Grim and [[Jovis]]. It's [[Sir Pergrim Dentar]]! [[Sir Grim]] tells him to join the group. He asked if they had met with [[Sir Henek Olem]] since he had tried arresting the group the first time. Sir Grim does most of the talking to try and divert his attention. Maybe he's a fucking narc? 

Jovis deduces that this guy does not give a shit about what Sir Grim is saying about [[Lot van Culnar]]. He's obviously just trying to determine if we've had any more interaction with [[The Knight Guard]]. Jovis decides to bore him with a story of woodworking to get him to stop prying.

Elias, Jem, and Sebael made it back to the Inn. Sir Grim informs us that Sir Pergrim visited them while they were gone. 
# Elias' Discovers the Truth of His Scar
Sebael has met [[Errog]] who gave the group the invitation to Whitefeather. 

Sebael and Elias sleep on the roof to divine the stars. Elias asks about a symbol etched into his skin. He acquired it when imprisoned in a mine. Sebael said it was familiar, but that he would need to meditate on it. He found out it was a symbol for the god [[Nangifer]], the god of monsters. Ripped his way out of his father and fed on his guts. Elias was very upset about this news and gained trauma.

Elias looked at the stars and got the feeling that they were not walking into a trap.

The next day, Elias gets paid for the assassination in 1,500 silver.
# The Road to Targus
The party made it to the [[Sheet Fish River]]. The next day we made it to a small village around evening. People are about, and Jem asks about it. Apparently, the sheriff caught an elvish spy in the nearby forest. Sebael was unaware that there were elves in the [[Arosel Forest]]. 

We make our way to the sheriff's office where the elf is being held. There is a large crowd. Jem inquired the crowd about the elf. He had mousy brown hair and was prancing around.

Sebael approaches the sheriff at the front of the crowd, attempting to present his liaison documentation. His name in [[Jon]]. Sebael asked if Jon had seen an elf before. He had seen some in Targus before and accurately described their appearance. We arrived in the cellar and the party recognized the voice as [[Eleen]]. Jem asked where [[Bizat]] is. It turns out he was looking for him.

We got Eleen out of there to help him find Bizat at the [[Arosel Stone Circle]]. Sebael suggested that we should just go see Whitefeather. We just go to find Bizat.
# The [[Arosel Stone Circle]]
We made it to the circle, but there was no Bizat. The circle had a very saturated hue, almost unnaturally. 

Fucking Maximus started casting [[Shadow Walking]] on the group, and Eleen really hated that. He drew his weapon ready to throw down, but then Maximus just made him forget what just happened.

[[Dragon]] sniffed Bizat's sword to attempt to locate him and he led the group to a large stone in the circle. Elias noticed some dwarf-sized footprints around the circle. He deduced that Bizat probably never left. The footprints just end at the circle. Jovis found a bit of singed cloth a ways behind one of the stones. There was also some thin bushes that were disturbed.

Jovis attempts to sit where Bizat was sitting, and they notice that the rock feels warmer than usual. Jovis goes back to the bushes and notices that some dwarvish footprints are leading to the edge of a cliff.

Sebael meditates at the circle to divine what happened. It is definitely a place where the gods are closer to earth. There did not seem to be any conflict. He figured that under the right circumstances, a human might be able to witness a magical thing. Sebael asks [[Dybbuk]] to bless him. A dead rotting raven appeared at his feet with a fresh sprig of poppy in its beak. Sebael goes about burning the offering.

The rest of the group makes it to the bottom of the cliff but didn't see Bizat. Elias broke a piece of the stone and Sebael was mortified that he just deface such a holy place.
