# [[Sebael Targus]] and [[Urath of Ur]]
Urath was clearly furious about the [[Wolverine Wood Lechid]]. He delivered an ultimatum to Sebael and left the room. After some time, Sebael left through a door and ended up with the party in Chasm Rankgor.
# In [[Chasm Rankgor]]
We are led through tunnels and whatever. We are definitely underground. Sick. [[Rurn]] takes us to the guest chambers. We must consider our address to the king. We should write out our address before we meet the king.

We got some pretty nice quarters tbh. It's spacious, but no doors between each other. [[Elias]] tries to move the massive door with geomancy but fails epically.

[[The Testament of Airesse]] appears to be a transcript of an elvish POW from [[The Third Great War]]. Airesse was a Sinari elf. The Oaken Throne is def a powerful weapon. It is somehow tied to the elvish faith and gods.

Rurn came back in and reviewed our letter. We decided to send the letter with him for the scribes to memorize.

## The letter:
Dear His Majesty Mr. The King, Esquire, His Royal Shortness,

We seek to prevent a calamity by destroying [[The Oaken Throne]]. We thank you for providing [[The Testament of Airesse]]. We believe it has information to destroy it. In addition, we seek the [[The Ecumenical Advance]], [[Conversations with an Autarch,]] and [[Footsteps of the Conqueror]]. The [[Thalmar]] believe these will lead them to the artifact. It is imperative that the artifact does not fall into their hands.

We believe the artifact is harbored in the [[Sinari Wood]]. NOT based of a shared vision we had of [[Sir Agaron of the Way]].

We will run point on this. It is our ultimate quest.

Love,
The Crew

P.S. We hate elves too. Also, can we get a doctor for our friend with split personalities?
# Meeting the King
Rurn and a lot of guards take us around the underground palace toward the audience chamber. The dwarven king is seated at the far end. The scribes announce the letter we had delivered. After they finish, the dwarves hum thoughtfully about what was said. The dwarf king holds up his hand, and speaks to an aid at his arm. The aid speaks to the herald. The herald speaks up and asks what we want.

We said safe passage to Sinari wood, information on where the books are in the letter, and permission to destroy the Oaken Throne. The herald asks if we trust someone to carry our message. Rurn enters the side chamber after a pause and says, 

"I don't know that we can give you these books you request. But, I can offer you passage to the Sinari wood, understanding the sensitivity of this situation, we will have to disavow you."

We will become enemies of the state (in name only).

DON'T FORGET THAT SEBAEL SHOULD GET A MYSTERY FROM HIS SPELLBOOK!
