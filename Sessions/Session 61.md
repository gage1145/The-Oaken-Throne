# [[Sebael Targus]] and [[Urath of Ur]]

We are led through tunnels and whatever. We are definitely underground. Sick. [[Rurn]] takes us to the guest chambers. We must consider our address to the king. We should write out our address before we meet the king.

We got some pretty nice quarters tbh. It's spacious, but no doors between each other.
