# Jem goes to the basement
[[Jem]] went to go watch a surgery. Not sure what he's getting out of this. Jem is glazing this dude *hard*. There's a guy with a rotten foot over in block E? Jem asked him about working on extending life expectancy by necromantic means. The chirurgist sends Jem away after telling him to not be too open with the others in the keep. The guy's name is [[Durm]].
# [[Sebael Targus]] seeks out [[Lady Alexa]]
The other ladies know of 3 Alexa's in the keep. The one that is avoiding Sebael is hanging out in a story above with some other nobles. He finds her and requests to speak alone. He asks if he had seen [[Doriel Tyrana]], an assassin that he knew in a past life.
# [[Maximus]] talks with [[Sir Grim]] about Alexa
Sir Grim says that he doesn't trust this bitch. He seems to think that she is playing games and is only putting on a show for the group.

[[Elias]] writes a letter to someone?

# Maximus and Elias seek out Lady Alexa
They try to figure out what her deal is, but it looks like she was just having fun being coy. She wonders why we are here and asks if we have made progress on [[Lot van Culnar]]'s instructions. She said that Lot had come through [[Damaria]] once or twice in the near history. 

***"Your future is not certain here." - Lady Alexa***
***"If you survive the feast, I have a message from my cousin. - Lady Alexa"***

Jem talks like a school girl to the telephone rock to [[Urath of Ur]] telling him all the goss.

# Preparing for the feast
The group hides the [[Black Book]] because it would almost certainly be confiscated. The group asks Sebael to step out during this, and he becomes suspicious. The group is also trying to keep the information from [[Sir Grim]], and he is very suspicious. He has been a part of the group since day one after all.

***"I assume this has something to do with your business in [[Tibara]]." - Sir Grim***

Sebael planted a seed of doubt in Sir Grim about the group.

Maximus asked his ***FUCKING ANGELS*** to tell him who was trying to kill [[Thomas Whitefeather]]. Of course he found out Sebael's plan...
# Elias speaks with Grim
Elias offers Grim to stab him if he offends him again? Grim does not understand the gesture.
