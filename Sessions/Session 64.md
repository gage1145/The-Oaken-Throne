# On the edge of the [[Sinari Wood]]
[[Sebael Targus]] cast [[Mystery of the Thousand Visages]] on [[Maximus]] to make him look like one of the [[Sinari Elves]]. The elves definitely saw this happen, and it will likely have no positive impact to us.

[[Jovis]] wrote a letter in [[Felya Sanari]] and attached it to [[Sacrifice]] and sent the sheep into the wood. The note warns of powerful forces that are seeking "a significant cultural item" and that we are willing to help them protect it. These forces believe it to be a weapon, and wish to use it for their own gain.

Sebael cast [[Mystery of the Dark Curses]] on Sacrifice to terrify him into the wood. Now we wait.

Two days later, two elves appear.

***"We received your message. We would like some clarification."***

[[Maximus]] basically just spilled the beans that [[Lot van Culnar]] and the [[Thalmar]] are after the Oaken throne. Also maybe the Grand Lamia.

***"What do you hope that we give you for this information?"***

Maximus said that we are hoping to prevent the [[Great Calamity]], and that our goals are aligned in keeping bad actors away from the weapon. We would like for them to help us help them.

***"What do you expect for your reception? Why do you think elves of our status would accept you?"***

The elves granted us access to 50ft inside the forest to protect us from the army gathering in [[Brasiva]].
# Scouting the army
Maximus and [[Elias]] shadow walk toward Brasiva to scout out the gathering army of [[Lot van Culnar]].

Maximus considered using his nuke magic to annihilate the gathering army, but he pussed out and ran back to the elves to see if they have a magical object that could help him do that. 
# Entering the Elvish City
The elves return and start leading us to the elvish crown prince. We eventually reach a building covered in lush forest greenery. Maximus and Jovis realized that this building was constructed specifically for this purpose.

At the end of the throne room, there is a dais with a throne, where the prince was sitting. The throne is cyprus (not oak...sad). He has a very tall silver crown atop his dome. 

***"These are the motherfuckers from the border."***

The prince was already aware of the easterners. Some of the issues are new to them.

The prince agrees to grant all of our wishes if we agree to bring the head of [[Lot van Culnar]] by morning.
