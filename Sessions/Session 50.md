# The Assassination
The [[Angels]] informed [[Maximus]] that the [[Golden Skull]] is guarded by a sea monster, so they decided to subvert the mutiny.

Maximus cuts the shadows from the masts to freak out the sailors I guess? They definitely freak out, and they think the skull is somehow doing this. Maximus makes 11 silver giving fake blessings to these idiots.

[[Elias]] suggests interrogating [[Mister Meers]] the head mutineer or attacking him while he's sleeping. He decides on killing the dude in his sleep. He scouts out the sleeping quarters.

***[[Sebael Targus]] and [[Elias]] notice something awry in the stars. A [[great calamity]] is coming...***

The day after, Elias and [[Y-lana]] have a conversation about how to kill Mister Meers. They both lurk to the quarters. ELias draws his weapon and briefly examines whether Meers is holding a weapon under the pillow. He is.

Elias gently pulls the knife from him and wakes him up asking to talk. Meers holds on to his dagger. Elias and Y-lana tell him to not be hasty.
