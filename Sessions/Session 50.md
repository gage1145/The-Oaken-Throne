# The Assassination of [[Mister Meers]]
The [[Angels]] informed [[Maximus]] that the [[Golden Skull]] is guarded by a [[sea serpent]], so they decided to subvert the mutiny.

Maximus cuts the shadows from the masts to freak out the sailors I guess? They definitely freak out, and they think the skull is somehow doing this. Maximus makes 11 silver giving fake blessings to these idiots.

[[Elias]] suggests interrogating [[Mister Meers]] the head mutineer or attacking him while he's sleeping. He decides on killing the dude in his sleep. He scouts out the sleeping quarters.

***[[Sebael Targus]] and [[Elias]] notice something awry in the stars. A [[great calamity]] is coming...***

The day after, Elias and [[Y-lana]] have a conversation about how to kill Mister Meers. They both lurk to the quarters. ELias draws his weapon and briefly examines whether Meers is holding a weapon under the pillow. He is.

Elias gently pulls the knife from him and wakes him up asking to talk. Meers holds on to his dagger. Elias and Y-lana tell him to not be hasty. He asks what our demands are. Elias asks what his intentions with the skull are. He is not planning on giving it to anyone. He says he was hired by [[The Man in Chains]]. He says to just kill him. Not like he could stop it. Elias informs Meers of the [[sea serpent]]. Elias just kills him by cutting his throat. They take his personal journal.
# [[The Great Bright]]
The crew goes above deck and the sun is unbearably bright. Soon it becomes clear that the brightness is supernatural. When everyone's vision clears, they are standing on a mountain pathway. Everyone meets Sebael! An old man in Daaktrain priest robes approaches, and asks [[Maximus]] if he is ok. He says we still have 3 more days along the pass. WTF?
# 4000 Years in the Past
Maximus notices our robes are old Jargen. The old man seems to be some kind of religious knight.

[[Sir Agaron of the Way]] says we are his escort to the [[Sinari Wood]] to recruit an elvish chieftain. We are now in a year that doesn't even use the same year naming convention we do. It was a dating system that was used near [[Duval]] before the establishment of the [[Jargen Empire]]. Just barely post-church of [[Daaktrianism]].

Agaron asks Elias if he remembers Thol (aka [[The Sword in The Soil]]). Elias says no. This must be some sort of message. Thol is "dead". He is in Daak's hall. He was in [[Tibara]] when it happened.

Elias mentions that there will eventually be a Lamia that will pose a threat to the church of [[Daak]]. 

The [[Lamia]] live in the [[Twilight Orchard]]. This could be a connection to [[The Primod]].

We camp down for the night. Agaron talks about a man he knew, and the battles he won. He speaks of [[Thol]] as a man or a friend rather than a prophet. At the end of the night, he said things were moving faster than Thol was prepared for, and he was not prepared for forming a church. 

Elias tells him about the other 3 prophets. He is especially interested in [[Udar]] who was compassionate, which Thol was not. [[Millergock]] warned of the 4th prophet [[The Lightbringer]].

# The Dragon
The next day, a dragon flies across the sky and burns everyone to death. We all immediately woke up where we were before the event.
