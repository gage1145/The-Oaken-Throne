# Searching the town for [[Bizat]]
A stocky dude approaches us and asks us our business. He says they have a dwarf in the village. It's probably Bizat. In fact it was Bizat! He doesn't seem too affected. [[Eleen]] goes to chat with him.

Bizat said he went to the stones and fell asleep waiting for Eleen. He was attacked by a spirit. 

[[Elias]] apologizes to Eleen for threatening to kill Bizat. Elias still doesn't like Bizat that much. Much less than Eleen. [[Jovis]] and [[Sebael Targus]] attempt to mentor him on proper apologies. [[Y'lana]] said he should just double down and threaten to kill him again.
# Elias talks to Bizat
He begrudgingly apologized. I'm not sure why. No one was asking him to do it. Bizat was confused and accepted the apology. Bizat actually mocked him for begging for forgiveness. It was pretty pathetic honestly. Elias snarls out "you're no god, and if you try to cash in on this debt, I WILL kill you." Elias stormed off completely unfulfilled.
# The Next Morning
Eleen mentions they too are heading toward [[Targus]]. Elias made breakfast? He was obsessed with taking everyone into the forest to see some weird ruins? He saw an entity that had rows of sharp teeth. There are tons of spirits and undead that this could be. Elias said it was [[Noxo]]. [[Sir Grim]] said it is a boogeyman to scare children - a terrible thing that has two faces. Sebael recalls that Noxo is also [[Nangifer]]. When he points this out to Elias, Elias attacks him. When he sees that everyone is about to engage in combat, he runs into the forest.
# Going into the Forest
[[Maximus]] and Sebael chase after him. Maximus yells at Sebael for telling Elias' secrets and shadow walks into the forest. Sebael is left alone in the field. He also continues toward the forest.

Sebael casts a concealing mist and a pea soup fog envelops the surrounding area. Maximus stops all the shadows and immobilizes Sebael and Elias. Elias slowly frees himself from the sticky shadows. 

Elias demanded that Sebael apologized. He did and as he was approaching, Sebael attempted to detect any spirits that may have possessed Elias. He's not even fucking possessed. It was just Elias. They made up.
# Back at Camp
[[Y'lana]] is pissed and attempts to punch Elias. Sebael insisted that she shouldn't hurt Elias and that it was his fault that Elias ran off into the forest. Grim asked what the fuck all that was about and insists that Elias' craziness may be due to Noxo. Sebael gives him a side-eye nod.
# Arriving in Targus
We arrived in [[Eram]] and met up with Bizat and Eleen. They aren't going our direction but they hope to see us again. A day later, we reached Targus. The guards at the wall told us that [[Thomas Whitefeather]] is at [[Demiliac's Fortress]] to the south of the city. The guards let us into the city.

Elias and Maximus go off on a shopping spree and buy some nice clothes for when we reach Whitefeather. For some reason, Elias is insisting on changing his hair color to green. I think he's having an identity crisis.

# Demiliac's Fortress
We arrive at the fortress and some guards ride their horses toward us to meet us.

*Who are you that come calling at Demiliac's Fortress?*

They confirmed that we had an invite. His name is [[Sir Idimus]]. They let us in. We are given a suite.
