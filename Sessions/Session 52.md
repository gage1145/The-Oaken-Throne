# Searching the town for [[Bizat]]
A stocky dude approaches us and asks us our business. He says they have a dwarf in the village. It's probably Bizat. In fact it was Bizat! He doesn't seem too affected. [[Eleen]] goes to chat with him.

Bizat said he went to the stones and fell asleep waiting for Eleen. He was attacked by a spirit. 

[[Elias]] apologizes to Eleen for threatening to kill Bizat. Elias still doesn't like Bizat that much. Much less than Eleen. [[Jovis]] and [[Sebael Targus]] attempt to mentor him on proper apologies. [[Y-lana]] said he should just double down and threaten to kill him again.
# Elias talks to Bizat
He begrudgingly apologized. I'm not sure why. No one was asking him to do it. Bizat was confused and accepted the apology. Bizat actually mocked him for begging for forgiveness. It was pretty pathetic honestly. Elias snarls out "you're no god, and if you try to cash in on this debt, I WILL kill you." Elias stormed off completely unfulfilled.
