[[Maximus]] and [[Elias]] went to see the [[Wolverine Wood Lechid]].
# Going to the Lechid
[[Jem]], [[Sebael Targus]], and Maximus go to the lechid. We came across a hunter's camp along the road. There are a few hunters there. There's another figure tied up. It's an elf, probably of the [[Thism Elves]]. Sebael tried speaking with the elf, but he had no interest in our help. Oh well, I tried. We decided to move along. That elf was a lost cause.

We finally reach the edge of the woods. We began to sing a song known to lure out the lechid or his familiars.

There was an elf at the edge. Sebael spoke with the elf in elvish, and explained that he planned to banish the lechid. He presented the elf a lechid heart to prove as such. Knowing that elves hate lechids, this proved fruitful. The elf decided to lead us to a gateway he knows.
# Elias in [[Axeholm]]
