# In The Wood
We're in a small encampment in the wood. We need to make a plan. We had initially decided on taking the 500 silver and the [[Ring of Thomas Whitefeather]]. We return to [[Thomas Whitefeather]]'s table to inform him of our decision. We actually talk to [[Steward Agram]]. [[Maximus]] informs the steward of our decision and that we will return in 6 months or sooner.

Maximus tells Whitefeather that [[Sebael Kess]] is an agent of [[Thalmar]]. Whitefeather asks his mage if this is true. The mage says "maybe?".

[[Elias]] informs the steward that the court mage is a traitor, and that the name of the witch lord is [[Sanguious Thalkatada]].

Whitefeather pull [[Sebael Targus]] aside and asks that he write back on the group's dealings.
# [[Demiliac's Fortress]]
Elias meets with [[Lady Alexa]]. Alexa asks about [[The Ecumenical Advance]]. How very suspicious that she asked about that book in Elias' presence.

We finally get our 500 silver. Sebael got 1000.
# The Road to [[Targus]]
 Nothing happened.
# In Targus
We all bought some horses! We've never had horses before! Sebael's is a palomino and his name is [[Horace]].
[[Rabbet]]: [[Jovis]]
[[Jetta]]: [[Y'lana]]
[[Minimus]]: [[Maximus]]
[[Endoscopy]]: [[Jem]]
[[Lil' Cal]]: [[Elias]]

# In [[Theranos]]
Alt Elias came out and had a crisis over killing people with Jovis.
# The Road to [[Urath of Ur]]
Jem opens up the [[Black Book]] and started to fucking go at it with a knife! He decided against it thank Daak. Eventually we make it to [[Helm]] and boarded the horses. We then continued to Urath's tower.

[[Avomorat]] emerged from the moat to greet us. We make our way to the library where Urath is waiting. He's fucking old as shit.
