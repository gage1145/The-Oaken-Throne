# The [[Chirurgy Guild]] Heist
[[Jem]] is heisting the surgical guild in the city. They argue that they left some equipment inside to get past the guards. Jem convinced them and only one guard went in with them.  Jem attempts to casually pocket some items as they are walking; they got a surgical kit. Jem casually leaves with the guard. It was a successful heist!

**Jem discovers they can't shadow walk anymore.**
# Escaping [[Tibara]]
[[Jem]], [[Maximus]], and [[Jovis]] stayed in Tibara while [[Domina]], [[Elias]], and [[Y-lana]] shadow walked out of the city. Elias failed, but Domina and Y-lana both used an advantage to save him. The plan is to meet up in a town to the south called [[Elatar]].

Jem informs Maximus and Jovis that their shadow walking is not working, and there are a looooot of guards patrolling. Jem asked Maximus if he could cast [[shadow walking]], but Maximus refused citing concern of magical detection surrounding the city.

Maximus dawns a monk's robe, and is playing like a monk who just wants some fresh air outside the city. Maximus and Jem make their way to the gate with the known corrupt guard. Maximus attempts to shadow walk out of the gate. He get's an advantage and escapes without a problem.

Jem approaches the gate and presents their guild papers, and exits the city without a problem.
# Visiting [[Rikkus]]
[[Jovis]] visits this guy to collect for getting his brother his indulgence. He gives a gold coin back to allow him to leave the city without issue. Jovis got 39 small gold coins total from this interaction.
# The Road to Elatar
## The 1st Group
Domina, Elias, and Y-lana make camp two days later outside of Elatar. Domina sees a vision of [[Fexior]] chanting her name in the woods.  She failed a supernatural test and lost 3 well-being. Y-lana gaslit Domina into thinking that she saw nothing, so she suppressed it and hoped she wouldn't see it again.
## The 2nd Group
Jem, Maximus, and Jovis are travelling together when they hear a hunting horn. They soon see a group of brightly dressed hunters approaching them on the road. Jem attempted to hide their hammer. Maximus cast [[shadow manipulation]]. A very flamboyant man named [[Franklin of Nines]] with a peacock feather in his hat approaches. He asks if they have seen trouble or danger. Maximus said they saw a mountain lion not too long ago. 

Apparently they are in this dud's Lord's lands, and there is a toll. Jovis gets very defensive toward this guy. This guy apparently buys the story that they have fallen on hard times. The toll is 30 silver or 15 if they have lunch with them. These guys are clearly battle-competent. 

Jovis knows that the lord is definitely a [[Primod]], and the party argues that it seems greedy for a primod to be begging for money. The guy says it's actually a common lord which is a blatant lie. Jovis introduces himself as [[Dovetail]].

The group agrees to pay the 15 silver and attend lunch with the merry men. He introduces them to his crew, known as [[The Bright Childs]]:
- [[Brother Lacus]]: An ex-high [[Inquisitor]] who is suspicious of Maximus for pretending to be a monk. Is very religious but obviously has an issue with the church. Maximus ingratiates himself to this guy. 

Maximus introduces himself as Brother [[Kilpiaho]]. 

Maximus notices that a few of them have some pagan charms hanging from their garb. There is also a trunk marked with arcane sigils. There are a couple charms that are definitely just marked with arcane sigils. Maximus asks about the idolatry. Jem asks about it, and [[Brother Lacus]] says that they are sigils of [[Zokar of Zim]], the resident magician.

Jem is honestly just happy to hang out and drink. Will probably fuck. Jem asks Lacus about finding a "truer path to [[Daak]]" than through the church.

Lacus tells of a story of him bringing the wrath of Daak upon a village on behalf of the church and burned four people. He seemed proud of this, but something about the story made him uncomfortable. Jem pushes on his hesitation, and Lacus shares that he was regretful that he wasn't less wasteful in his zeal. Still enjoys wrath though??

**"Authority is a trap"** - [[Brother Lacus]]

Jem challenges him on his motivations and whether his wrathful approach to [[Daaktrianism]] is effectful. His Jordan Peterson style of debate utterly destroys Jem, and they are emmasculated.

**"Who said I was a Daaktrian?"** - [[Brother Lacus]]

As they are leaving, [[Franklin of Nines]] asks if they would like an escort. The group refuses. He offers an open invitation to dine with them anytime. Before leaving, Maximus asks Lacus to pray with him. Lacus calls him on his bullshit. 

**"You stink of wizardry!"** - [[Brother Lacus]]
# The Party Converges
Maximus proposes killing this people and bankers of Elatar because he has no money. This causes the party to just lose their shit and they all rolled self-control for violence. Clearly Maximus is not used to not having money. Y-lana and Jem give him 200 and 10 silver, respectively.

Some members of the party hear a tiny bell nearby. It's a little brown cat with a bell collar. Domina asks it its name; [[Bones]]. He came from [[Urath of Ur]]! He was worried about us. That's so sweet. We should consider that Urath could help us with the [[Black Book]]. [[Dragon]] is extremely jealous of [[Bones]].

**"The cat's a spy."** - [[Dragon]]

We made camp. Elias and Domina take the first watch. Domina calls out to to [[Fexior]], and Fexior retreats slowly into the wood. Domina tell Elias she's taking a bush wee and decided to follow the beast. Domina lost all her well-being in this encounter.  

We continued down the road farther south. On the second day out from meeting Bones, we noticed an unfamiliar castle. We had heard that this area is lorded by a knight called [[Aminus Gondus Amus]]. We go into the nearby town and buy some rations.

Jem hears around town that there is definitely a new war brewing with [[Drunok]].

# We Arrive in Duval

We arrive on [[All Souls Day]], a day to commemorate zealot warriors. [[Sir Grim]] meets up with us, and Maximus asks if he wants to just stay here in [[Lot van Culnar]]'s house. He had a letter from Culnar saying that we'll have to do some more sniffing on our own. We must find a book called [[The Testament of Airesse]] which talks of [[The Oaken Throne]].

Grim squeals in joy that we have Bones.
