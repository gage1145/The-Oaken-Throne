# Leaving [[Duval]]
[[Maximus]] needs his laylines! Listening to the angels, there is no mundane way to read the [[Black Book]]. We will likely need magic. Maximus tells the box that conflict is about to erupt between the empire and [[Drunok]]. 

We discussed getting a boat to [[Axholm]] or even all the way to [[Amra]].  We discussed rebinding the Black Book. [[Domina]] suggested absolutely not doing that? Maximus settled on just covering the book. [[Domina]] is still very uncomfortable with this plan. She would rather not deface the book at all. Maximus disguises it as a book about commerce in [[Duval]].

[[Elias]] finds a boat leaving for [[Malorian]]. He could fit us aboard. It's in the direction, but kind of out of the way. 45 silver per head. 

[[Jem]] attempted to inspect the lock on the black book. It's just a regular lock. [[Elias]] was able to feel along the pages, and could feel the impressions of the pen strokes, but was not able to decipher any letters. 
# [[Domina]] Dies
Someone is attempting to steal the book from Elias. It's Domina! Elias attacks Domina without knowing it was her. He stabbed her in the neck and **she fucking died**.

Elias becomes catatonic from fucking killing Domina. Elias also gains the "split personality" trait. [[Jem]] witnessed the whole thing and gained the "fixation" trait.

The rest of the party strolled in and were unbothered lol.
