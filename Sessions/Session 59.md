# The road to [[shuliae H'noro]]
 The party is hesitant to follow the elves into their high city. [[Sebael Targus]] assures them that there is nothing to worry about. Unfortunately, the main elf let it spill that it was Sebael's plan to go to the city. Sebael had to explain that it was his dream to visit an elvish city.

They ask if we need help setting up camp. We say no. Sebael climbs a tree to divine the stars and asks if his plan is ill-fated...it is.

"It can be done, but not by you" - the stars

We came to a stop and informs us that we have arrived. There was nothing to be found.

The head elf handed me a handful of jerky. A peace offering??
# In Axeholm
[[Maximus]], [[Sir Grim]], and [[Jem]] decide to go back to the road to tend to the horses and to wait for [[Elias]] in [[Axeholm]]. Sebael, [[Y'lana]], and [[Jovis]] go with the elves. They find Elias on the road, and continue to Axeholm.

Jem attempts to study the [[Black Book]]. This was definitely written by a small conspiracy of people that absolutely hated the [[The Sword in The Soil]]. 

Maximus is looking for leads on [[Chlamydia von Theranos]].
