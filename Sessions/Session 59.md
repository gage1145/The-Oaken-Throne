# The road to [[shuliae H'noro]]
 The party is hesitant to follow the elves into their high city. [[Sebael Targus]] assures them that there is nothing to worry about. Unfortunately, the main elf let it spill that it was Sebael's plan to go to the city. Sebael had to explain that it was his dream to visit an elvish city.

They ask if we need help setting up camp. We say no. Sebael climbs a tree to divine the stars and asks if his plan is ill-fated...it is.

"It can be done, but not by you" - the stars

We came to a stop and informs us that we have arrived. There was nothing to be found.

The head elf handed me a handful of jerky. A peace offering?? He fucked off to find a representative.

Soon some elves arrive. A tall one with a strong jaw approaches. He picked out Jovis and said, **"I didn't expect to see you here, tall one."**  

His name is [[Belian]], an elf that previously fought Jovis!

I began talking to him about [[The Testament of Airesse]], and all the elves immediately drew their weapons. He tried to intimidate us, but was incredibly unsuccessful. He had a breakdown and pissed his pants.

Y'lana asks about some of their great ancient wars. They tell her about some of their greatest losses. The next morning they led us out of the forest into the outskirts of [[Brasiva]].
# In [[Axeholm]]
[[Maximus]], [[Sir Grim]], and [[Jem]] decide to go back to the road to tend to the horses and to wait for [[Elias]] in [[Axeholm]]. Sebael, [[Y'lana]], and [[Jovis]] go with the elves. They find Elias on the road, and continue to Axeholm.

Jem attempts to study the [[Black Book]]. This was definitely written by a small conspiracy of people that absolutely hated the [[The Sword in The Soil]]. Jem also found that the writers wrote that they buried the body in [[Tibara]].

Maximus is looking for leads on [[Chlamydia von Theranos]].

[[Lot van Culnar]] found the split party, and told them that they must find the two books and [[The Oaken Throne]] or he would have everyone hunted.
