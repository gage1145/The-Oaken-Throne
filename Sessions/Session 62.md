# The Plans to Find [[The Oaken Throne]]
- Plan A - False flag; start war with Sinari Elves and [[Thomas Whitefeather]]
- Plan B - Lord of War; we become weapons dealers to ramp up conflict like in the movie War dogs
- Plan C - Kill our way to the center of the [[Sinari Wood]].
- Plan D - Disguise ourselves as elves
- Plan E - Distribute drugs amongst the Sinari elves
- Plan F - Ask the angels what we should do
- Plan G - [[Sebael Targus]] learns necromancy
- Plan H - Shadow walk through the Sinari Wood to find [[Elias]]' former boss [[Lord Mask]].
- Plan I - Side with the elves
	- They haven't done anything with it for millenia, so maybe we should warn them of the impending struggle coming their way
- Plan J - False flag with [[Thalmar]] and [[Lot van Culnar]]
- Plan K - Just walk in there and have the dwarves publicly exile us
- Plan L - Go back to [[Tibara]] and exhume the body of [[Thol]].
- Plan M - Find [[Franklin of Nines]] and [[Brother Lacus]] and [[The Bright Childs]]?
- Plan N - Become Lady Whistledown
# [[Jem]] writes a letter to [[The Bright Childs]]
Jem starts writing a letter to inform them about the location of the body of [[The Sword in The Soil]]. Y'lana paid 50 silver for a courier to deliver it, and this hopefully will nullify our debt to the Primod.
# We go to [[Brasiva]]
