# Infiltrating the [[Abarat's Palace]] Cont'd

[[Domina]] used [[Shadow Walking]] to get into the room containing the [[Black Book]]. It is completely dark, so she has to feel around. She finds the book, but it's chained to the pedestal. Guards with flaming swords surrounded [[Maximus]] and [[Elias]]. [[Maximus]] kneels down and pretends to pray as if he doesn't know what's happening. Elias makes his way into the room. Elias tries to use an armorer's tool to break the chain and is successful.

The guards attempt to manacle Maximus. He shadow walks away before they get the chance. He also engulfs the entire hallway in darkness. Domina peaks out the hole and shadow walks toward the darkness. She immediately is in danger of three guards that arrive as she does.

Maximus stepped in front of Domina and casted [[Hand of Heavy Ether]]. One guy fucking dies instantly by fucking melting. Maximus screamed "How dare you question [[Daak]]'s power!". Another guy melts instantly. Finally, the last guys eyes pop like eggs in a microwave, and he also melts jfc. Domina and Maximus had to do a supernatural trauma test. Domina failed and lost 3 wellbeing. Domina also picked up one of the flaming swords. It lost its flame.

Two more guards attack Domina and she deftly parried both of them. I'm just as surprised as you. Maximus then came up and casted [[Space Flame]]. He got like 6 fucking advantage lol. Definitely killed two of the guards, and another one was rendered barely alive with his skin melted. Another one had his face lit on fire, but lived.

In total, 3 die, and 2 are barely alive.

Elias shadow walked away to scout ahead. Maximus and Domina both succeeded in parrying the attacks from the 2 others.

Domina and Maximus shadow walk out. Domina yells that this whole thing was done on behalf of the [[Drunok]] empire. Domina managed to roll really well to shadow walk and helped Elias escape. Basically everyone in this group got their level 3 trait! The Church will trace this back to [[Bold Ferinius]]. We should kill him!

# [[Bold Ferinius]] Assassination Cont'd

[[Jovis]] and [[Y-lana]] are waiting on the rooftop waiting for this guy to exit. There are two guys waiting around guarding the door. The two PC's hear them talking, but it's just dumbass banter. Completely useless information. They sneak in through a window. Y'lana actually shadow walks in because apparently she still had it from a previous session. It's a well-furnished room, a study maybe. She listens at the door and hears a couple soft voices, perhaps playing a game. She looks through the keyhole and decides to shadow walk through. Y-lana opens a window to let Jovis into the study.

After discussing what to do, Y-lana shadow walked outside to find a new window? There's another door, and nobody inside the room. They finally get to a room with a woman in bed who asks what they're doing there.

Y'lana attempts to deceive her by making her think she made a vow of silence since she was in monk clothes.

[[Y-lana]] finally makes it into the room with Bold Ferinius. It is filled with tobacco smoke. There is another man with him. Y-lana shadow walks behind Ferinius. Y-lana fucking stabs him in his throat. She then lunges over the table to stab the other guy. She stabs him so hard in the arm that she broke his bone.

Jovis went through Ferinius' desk drawer and found a pouch of gold! Jovis staged the scene to make it seem like they killed each other.

Jovis and Y-lana escape from the building and set it on fire lol.

# The team reunites!

We all got back to the apartment. [[Jem]] is just stepping out of the bath. Jem gives [[Maximus]] a letter from a cousin that isn't in the "in group". He will have to stay for a while to be a juror on a trial that has implications on his father's honor.

We decide that we need to immediately gtfo of the city.

Jovis and Y-lana got a total of 5,400 silver ($108,000)!
