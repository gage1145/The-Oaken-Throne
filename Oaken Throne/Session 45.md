## 2nd Meeting with [[Bold Ferenius]]
[[Elias]] came with [[Domina]]. Paid 200 silver for the plan. [[Prelod Vargus]] will be our guide into the [[Vatican]].  We will be diplomats from [[Drunok]]. We must know lower [[Jargen]] but we don't have the right accents. 

We have a unique opportunity to access the archives. We should use this moment to case the joint. We won't cast angel spell. 

## After leaving the meeting
We debate about whether [[Maximus]] should use [[Angels]] to learn about [[The Oaken Throne]] or about [[The Sword in The Soil]]. 
## What is our backstory?
We are diplomats from [[Drunok]]. The reason we don't have accents is because we emigrated there. We are sympathetic to [[Daktrianism]] in [[Tavara]].
## [[Jovis]] and [[Y-lana]] follow [[Bold Ferenius]] 
[[Jovis]] follow him to the slums of [[Tavara]]. 4 guys were with him, only 2 went in. [[Y-lana]] dropped all of her armor and weapons since none of it was concealable. She keeps [[Dagger]]. They consider fucking killing this guy lol. They are also considering where to hide while they wait for these fuckers to exit.
## Infiltrating the [[Vatican]]
[[Prelod Vargus]] tells us to change our clothes into our diplomat clothes. We will meet him at 5pm at some address. [[Elias]] and [[Domina]] go back to meet up with the rest of the group.

[[Domina]] and [[Y-lana]] go to meet the Prelod. [[Maximus]] immediately introduces himself. The Prelod demands another 150 silver or he's telling everyone our plan.

The [[Aberat]] has been focused on restoration of the religious architecture in [[Tavara]]. 

Maximus asked his [[Angels]] what to do and they told him to join the priesthood? Maximus rolls to see if there is anything clandestine here, but finds nothing.

[[Domina]] rolled excellently to charm [[Arius]], a monk in the [[Vatican]], to show us some secret shit. He led us to the iron-gated room to the [[Black Book]]. Hidden within a completely sealed vault out of view.

[[Elias]] absolutely needed the book and decided to fucking metal bend the seal to open the vault!  [[Maximus]] cast [[shadow manipulation]] (4d6+2 death) before Elias did his shit. Then Elias blasted open the vault with his [[Geomancy]] with 4 advantage.

## Session Ended
We are still in the surprise round, and Domina still has an action.
